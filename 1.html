  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p>HTML (<a href="http://www.w3.org/"target="_blank"title="html justice">
    the HypertextMarkup Language</a>) and
  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are twoof the core technologies
  for building Webpages. HTML provides the structure of the
  page, CSS the(visual and aural) layout, for avariety
  of devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and
  CSSare the basis of
  building Web pages and WebApplications.if you were meeting
  <strong>the same <u>people</u></strong> to play a board game,
  it would be completely acceptable for the same Joe
   to prevent you from winning the game.
 But it has gone too far.
   Most patents are now as much about defending monopoly and
    discouraging rivals as about sharing ideas.

  And that disrupts
     innovation. Many firms use patents as barriers to entry,
     suing upstart innovators who trespass on their intellectual
      property even on the way to some other goal. In the years
      before World War I, aircraft makers tied each other up
      in patent lawsuits and slowed down innovation until the government
      stepped in. Much the same has happened with smartphones
      and biotechnology today. New entrants have to fight
      their way through “patent thickets” if they are to build
      on existing technologies to make new ones.</p>
